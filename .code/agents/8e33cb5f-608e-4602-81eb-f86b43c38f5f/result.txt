Context: The repository is an Angular course delivered entirely through Markdown lessons and exercises. Key files:
- lesson-signals.md: teaches Angular Signals basics (creating signals, reading, updating, computed signals, dynamic dependencies, effects, best practices).
- exercise-signals.md: placeholder for new exercises focused on Signals.

Goal: produce a plan outlining sections, exercise structure, necessary code snippets, level progression, review checklist, and any supporting assets needed to draft the new exercise file.

Agent: We need a concrete plan for writing focused exercises about Angular Signals in the repository at /Users/elad/dev/angular/angularcourse-md. The target file is exercise-signals.md (currently empty). Use lesson-signals.md for background material‚Äîthe lessons explain signals basics, computed signals, and usage patterns. Please propose actionable steps to create engaging exercises (with prompts, expected outcomes, and potential code examples) that align with the lesson content, fit the repo's markdown-based course style, and remain concise for learners. Consider existing files like exercise1.md and exercise2.md as references for formatting if helpful.

# Angular Signals

## Topic Overview

Angular Signals is a stable reactive programming system (as of Angular 20) that provides fine-grained reactivity for managing state in Angular applications. Signals represent values that can change over time and automatically notify interested consumers when they change.

### What are Signals?

A signal is a wrapper around a value that notifies interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from primitives to complex data structures. You read a signal's value by calling its getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.

### Key Benefits

- **Fine-grained reactivity**: Only components that depend on changed signals are updated
- **Automatic dependency tracking**: Angular automatically tracks which signals your code reads
- **Improved performance**: More efficient change detection, especially with zoneless mode
- **Better developer experience**: Type-safe reactive state management
- **Simplified debugging**: Clear dependency graphs and predictable updates
- **Zoneless compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Angular's zoneless change detection

### Why Use Signals?

    return `${userName()} (${userEmail()})`;
  } else {
    return userName();
  }
});

// Initially, only userName and showDetails are dependencies
// userEmail becomes a dependency only when showDetails is true
```

### Component Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal, computed, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';

interface CartItem {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;

// L Avoid - can cause infinite loops
effect(() => {
  const value = mySignal();

});

//  Good - effect for side effects only
effect(() => {
  const value = mySignal();
  console.log('Value changed:', value);
});
```

## Signal Inputs

Signal inputs provide a stable, modern, type-safe way to accept data from parent components using the reactive power of signals. As of Angular 20, signal inputs are the recommended approach for component inputs.

**Creating exercise development plan**

I‚Äôm mapping out a detailed plan for writing a new exercise file that references the large doc, emphasizing second-person instructions, section headings, short paragraphs, and code blocks aligned with repo style. The plan will include structuring levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) with tasks covering signals concepts, self-check points, code snippets like Counter components and computed lists, linking to lesson-signals.md, and verifying solutions using Angular CLI sandbox. I‚Äôll also include a review checklist for formatting and linting, plus suggestions for supporting assets like sample interfaces to round it out. This plan stays focused on guiding exercise creation rather than doing it outright.

**Exercise Plan**
- Start with a short intro paragraph in `exercise-signals.md` that reminds learners this exercise expands on `lesson-signals.md` and tells them they will build progressively richer signal-powered features.
- Structure the exercise into three tiers‚ÄîFoundations, Derived State, and Side Effects & I/O‚Äîwith clear ATX headings and concise instructions written in second-person voice.
- Foundations tier: have learners create a `CounterComponent` using `signal`, `set`, and `update`, plus a follow-up task that migrates inputs in an existing `UserCardComponent` to the `input()` API; include expected behavior bullets so they can self-check.
- Derived State tier: ask learners to build a `CartTotalsComponent` using `computed` for totals and averages and to add an `@for` block that demonstrates dynamic dependency tracking; provide a TypeScript snippet skeleton they must complete.
- Side Effects & I/O tier: require adding an `effect` that syncs preferences to `localStorage`, another effect that debounces search analytics, and a challenge that wires a child component‚Äôs `output()` events into a parent signal-based state machine; outline acceptance criteria for each effect (when it runs, cleanup expectations).
- Add an optional ‚ÄúBonus‚Äù section that nudges advanced learners to implement signal-based form validation with computed error messages and effect-driven submission logging.
- Provide a short ‚ÄúExercise Flow‚Äù checklist summarizing the progression (build base signals ‚Üí derive state ‚Üí manage side effects ‚Üí optional bonus).
- Embed self-check sections at the end of every tier with 3‚Äì4 bullet validations (e.g., ‚Äú`count()` updates immediately when you click the increment button‚Äù).
- List the concrete snippets needed: component skeletons with Angular standalone metadata, interface definitions for cart items, effect examples showing `onCleanup`, and parent/child templates demonstrating signal inputs/outputs.
- Under ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù remind learners to spin up an Angular CLI sandbox (`npx -p @angular/cli ng new tmp-sandbox`) and run the snippets to confirm compilation before marking the exercise complete.
- Finish with a ‚ÄúReview Checklist‚Äù covering Markdown linting (`npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"`), Prettier check, verifying links to `lesson-signals.md`, ensuring second-person tone, and keeping code blocks under 80 characters width.
- Call out any supporting assets to prepare beforehand: a small JSON-like mock data block for cart items, a reusable debounce utility mention, and references to the relevant lesson sections (anchors) for quick navigation.
