Context: The repository is an Angular course delivered entirely through Markdown lessons and exercises. Key files:
- lesson-signals.md: teaches Angular Signals basics (creating signals, reading, updating, computed signals, dynamic dependencies, effects, best practices).
- exercise-signals.md: placeholder for new exercises focused on Signals.

Goal: produce a plan outlining sections, exercise structure, necessary code snippets, level progression, review checklist, and any supporting assets needed to draft the new exercise file.

Agent: We need a concrete plan for writing focused exercises about Angular Signals in the repository at /Users/elad/dev/angular/angularcourse-md. The target file is exercise-signals.md (currently empty). Use lesson-signals.md for background material—the lessons explain signals basics, computed signals, and usage patterns. Please propose actionable steps to create engaging exercises (with prompts, expected outcomes, and potential code examples) that align with the lesson content, fit the repo's markdown-based course style, and remain concise for learners. Consider existing files like exercise1.md and exercise2.md as references for formatting if helpful.

# Angular Signals

## Topic Overview

Angular Signals is a stable reactive programming system (as of Angular 20) that provides fine-grained reactivity for managing state in Angular applications. Signals represent values that can change over time and automatically notify interested consumers when they change.

### What are Signals?

A signal is a wrapper around a value that notifies interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from primitives to complex data structures. You read a signal's value by calling its getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.

### Key Benefits

- **Fine-grained reactivity**: Only components that depend on changed signals are updated
- **Automatic dependency tracking**: Angular automatically tracks which signals your code reads
- **Improved performance**: More efficient change detection, especially with zoneless mode
- **Better developer experience**: Type-safe reactive state management
- **Simplified debugging**: Clear dependency graphs and predictable updates
- **Zoneless compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Angular's zoneless change detection

### Why Use Signals?

    return `${userName()} (${userEmail()})`;
  } else {
    return userName();
  }
});

// Initially, only userName and showDetails are dependencies
// userEmail becomes a dependency only when showDetails is true
```

### Component Example

```typescript
import { Component, signal, computed, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';

interface CartItem {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;

// L Avoid - can cause infinite loops
effect(() => {
  const value = mySignal();
  mySignal.set(value + 1); // Writes to the signal it reads!
});

//  Good - effect for side effects only
effect(() => {
  const value = mySignal();
  console.log('Value changed:', value);
});
```

## Signal Inputs

Signal inputs provide a stable, modern, type-safe way to accept data from parent components using the reactive power of signals. As of Angular 20, signal inputs are the recommended approach for component inputs.

### Basic Signal Inputs

        console.log('Updating user:', action.userId);
        break;
      case 'delete':
        // Handle user deletion
        this.users.update(users =>
          users.filter(user => user.id !== action.userId)
        );
        break;
    }
  }

Examples of good use cases:
- Form field validation events
- Button click events with data
- Modal dialog results
- Search box queries
- Pagination events
- File upload progress
- Game events and actions

## Model Inputs

Model inputs enable two-way data binding between parent and child components using signals. They allow a component to both receive values from and send values back to its parent.

### Basic Model Inputs

```typescript
import { Component, model } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-input',

**Outlining exercise development plan**

I’m putting together a detailed plan for an Angular Signals practice exercise aligned with repo style and lesson content. The plan will structure the file into clear sections—title, intro, overview, progressive tasks on signals basics through advanced concepts, self-check bullet points, and a review checklist—while including coding snippet guidance and maintaining second-person, concise paragraph style. I'll also suggest optional support assets and referencing the relevant lesson content without heavy file citations. This should create a solid framework for the user to build and maintain consistency.
[2025-09-19T12:20:35] codex

**Proposed Exercise Plan**

- `# Angular Signals Practice` opening with a short intro and learning goals in second-person voice; mention prerequisites (Angular CLI sandbox) and link back to the signals lesson.
- Structure the body with `## Exercise Overview`, `## Task 1 – Warm Up`, `## Task 2 – Derived State`, `## Task 3 – Component Collaboration`, `## Stretch Goals`, `## Self-Check`, `## Review Checklist`, `## Supporting Assets`.

- **Task 1 – Warm Up (Level 1)**
  - Scenario: build a `TaskCounterComponent` that tracks open/completed tasks using writable signals.
  - Prompts: create two signals (`openCount`, `completedCount`), render values in template, wire three buttons (`Add Task`, `Complete Task`, `Reset`).
  - Expected outcome: learners demonstrate `.set()` vs `.update()` and template binding with `{{ signal() }}`.
  - Snippets to provide: `component.ts` showing signal creation and methods; small HTML block with buttons bound to click handlers.
  - Include self-check bullets such as “Button clicks update the rendered values instantly.”

- **Task 2 – Derived State (Level 2)**
  - Scenario: extend the counter into a `TaskStatsComponent` with computed signals and an effect.
  - Prompts: introduce a `tasks = signal<Task[]>(...)`; add `pendingTasks`/`doneTasks` computed signals, and an effect persisting tasks to `localStorage`.
  - Expected outcome: highlight memoized computations and side-effect hygiene (cleanup discussion optional).
  - Snippets: TypeScript interface, computed signal definitions, `effect` block with `onCleanup` placeholder.
  - Encourage learners to run in Angular CLI sandbox to confirm persistence behaviour.

- **Task 3 – Component Collaboration (Level 3)**
  - Scenario: compose a small dashboard with `TaskListComponent` (uses signal inputs), `TaskComposerComponent` (model input for two-way binding), and `TaskListFooterComponent` (signal outputs for filters).
  - Prompts:
    - Parent `TaskBoardComponent` holds master `tasks` signal and passes slices via signal inputs.
    - Child form component exposes `[(taskDraft)]` via `model` to push new tasks.
    - Footer emits `filterChanged` output using `output<'all' | 'open' | 'done'>()`.
    - Demonstrate `@for` control flow in template.
  - Expected outcome: show signal-based component API design and event communication.
  - Snippets: component skeletons (`ts` + `html`) demonstrating inputs/outputs/model usage; emphasize two-space indentation and Angular control flow examples.

- **Stretch Goals**
  - Optional prompts: add a `computed` that returns statistics for charting, introduce a debounced effect for server sync, layer in signal queries for DOM focus management.
  - Clearly mark as optional to keep core exercise concise.

- **Self-Check Section**
  - Bullet list (as required by repo guidelines) including items like “You can explain why the effect belongs in an injection context” and “Filtering updates without redundant renders.”

- **Review Checklist**
  - Confirm lesson cross-links (link back to relevant headings in the signals lesson), terminology matches Angular 20 naming, code fences labelled `ts` / `html`, paragraphs short, headings use ATX style with blank lines, snippet indentation conforms.
  - Ensure instructions stay in second-person voice, and computed/effect examples avoid infinite loops.

- **Supporting Assets**
  - Suggest a reusable mock data snippet (`const seedTasks = [...]`) and mention optional screenshot once rendered.
  - Note that no additional files are required, but encourage learners to spin up `npx -p @angular/cli ng new signals-sandbox` for validation.

This outline keeps the exercise progressive, mirrors the concepts in the signals lesson, and matches the Markdown style conventions already used across the course.
