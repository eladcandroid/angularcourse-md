Okay, I have reviewed the content of `lesson-signals.md`, `exercise1.md`, and `exercise2.md`.

*   `lesson-signals.md` provides a comprehensive overview of Angular Signals, including `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, inputs, outputs, model inputs, queries, and the resource API.
*   `exercise1.md` and `exercise2.md` are more high-level and architectural, focusing on application structure and design patterns rather than small, focused code tasks. They provide a title and a list of requirements.

Based on this, I will propose a plan for `exercise-signals.md` that creates smaller, more focused exercises that directly map to the concepts in `lesson-signals.md`. This will provide a better learning progression for the user.

Here is the plan:

### Plan for `exercise-signals.md`

The new exercise file will contain a series of focused, hands-on exercises that build on each other, allowing learners to practice the core concepts of Angular Signals as taught in `lesson-signals.md`.

---

**1. Proposed Sections**

The file will be structured into clear, progressive sections:

1.  **Introduction**: Briefly explain the goal of the exercises.
2.  **Exercise 1: Your First Signal - A Simple Counter**: Focus on creating, reading, and updating a basic `signal`.
3.  **Exercise 2: Derived State with `computed` - A Shopping Cart**: Practice creating `computed` signals that derive state from other signals.
4.  **Exercise 3: Side Effects with `effect` - Logging User Actions**: Learn how to use `effect` to run side effects in response to signal changes.
5.  **Exercise 4: Putting It All Together - A "To-Do" List**: A slightly larger exercise combining `signal`, `computed`, and `effect` to build a small, functional piece of an application.
6.  **Solutions**: A section at the end with complete, working code for each exercise.

**2. Structure for Each Exercise**

Each exercise will follow a consistent and clear format:

*   **Objective**: A one-sentence summary of what the learner will achieve.
*   **Instructions**: A clear, step-by-step prompt guiding the user.
*   **Starter Code**: A pre-filled Angular component snippet for the user to modify. This saves time and focuses the exercise on the target concept.
*   **Expected Outcome**: A description of how the component should behave after the exercise is completed correctly.
*   **Bonus (Optional)**: An extra challenge to encourage further exploration.

**3. Code Snippets & Level Progression**

The exercises will start simple and gradually introduce more complexity.

*   **Exercise 1 (Beginner)**:
    *   **Concept**: `signal()`, `.set()`, `.update()`.
    *   **Task**: Create a counter component with increment, decrement, and reset functionality.
    *   **Starter Code**: A component with a `count` signal initialized to `0` and empty methods.

*   **Exercise 2 (Intermediate)**:
    *   **Concept**: `computed()`.
    *   **Task**: Create a shopping cart that has a signal for items and uses `computed` to calculate the total number of items and the total price.
    *   **Starter Code**: A component with an `items` signal (an array of objects with `price` and `quantity`).

*   **Exercise 3 (Intermediate)**:
    *   **Concept**: `effect()`.
    *   **Task**: Create a component that logs a message to the console whenever a user's name signal changes.
    *   **Starter Code**: A component with a `userName` signal and an input field to change it.

*   **Exercise 4 (Advanced)**:
    *   **Concept**: Combination of all previous concepts.
    *   **Task**: Build a simple to-do list where users can add items. Use `signal` for the list, and `computed` to derive statistics (e.g., number of completed items). An `effect` could be used to log the list state to local storage.
    *   **Starter Code**: A component with an empty `todos` signal and an input field for adding new to-dos.

**4. Review Checklist**

Before finalizing the file, I will use this checklist:

*   [ ] Are the instructions for each exercise clear and unambiguous?
*   [ ] Does the starter code provide enough context without giving away the solution?
*   [ ] Does each exercise directly correspond to a topic in `lesson-signals.md`?
*   [ ] Is the level progression logical?
*   [ ] Are the solutions correct, complete, and well-formatted?
*   [ ] Does the overall file format match the style of `exercise1.md` and `exercise2.md` (e.g., use of headings, code blocks)?

**5. Supporting Assets**

*   No external assets are needed. All exercises will be self-contained within the markdown file, using standard Angular and TypeScript code snippets.

This plan provides a clear path to creating an engaging and effective exercise file for Angular Signals that aligns with the existing course structure.
