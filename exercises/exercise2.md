ðŸ“š Library Management System - Design Patterns Exercise
Exercise: Implement Design Patterns in the Library Management System
Building upon your existing Library Management System, implement the three design patterns to enhance the application's architecture and functionality.

ðŸ“‹ Exercise Instructions
1. Book Management Facade Pattern
Create a comprehensive facade service that simplifies all book-related operations:
Requirements:
Combine BookService, InventoryService, and ReservationService
Provide a unified API for book operations
Handle book availability checking across multiple sources
Manage book reservations and waitlists
Cache frequently accessed books
Track reading history


Implementation Tasks:

// Create these methods in BookFacadeService: 
- searchBooks(query: string, filters?: BookFilters): Observable<Book[]> 
- getBookDetails(bookId: string): Observable<BookDetails> 
- reserveBook(bookId: string, memberId: string): Observable<Reservation> 
- checkAvailability(bookId: string): Observable<AvailabilityStatus> 
- getRecommendations(memberId: string): Observable<Book[]> 
- addToWaitlist(bookId: string, memberId: string): Observable<WaitlistEntry>

2. Application State Singleton Pattern
Implement a singleton service to manage global application state:
Requirements:
Library configuration (opening hours, fine rates, loan periods)
User session management
Notification preferences
Theme settings (light/dark mode)
Language preferences
Cache management

// Create LibraryConfigService as singleton: 
- getLibrarySettings(): LibrarySettings 
- updateOpeningHours(hours: OpeningHours): void 
- getFineRate(): number 
- getMaxLoanPeriod(): number 
- getCurrentTheme(): Theme 
- setTheme(theme: Theme): void - clearAllCaches(): void

3. Notification Service Locator Pattern
Build a dynamic notification system that can load different notification providers:
Requirements:
Support multiple notification channels (Email, SMS, Push, In-App)
Dynamic provider loading based on user preferences
Fallback mechanism for failed providers
Template-based notifications
Priority-based routing

// Create notification system with Service Locator: 
- registerProvider(type: string, provider: NotificationProvider): void 
- sendNotification(type: string, recipient: string, template: string, data: any): Observable<boolean> 
- sendBulkNotifications(notifications: BulkNotification[]): Observable<NotificationResult[]> 
- getAvailableProviders(): string[] 
- setUserNotificationPreferences(userId: string, preferences: NotificationPreferences): void
